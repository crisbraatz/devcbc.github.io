      <description>The motivation When I was in college, I attended a course of crypthography which whom our professor challenged us to code the enigma machine algorithm in Java. I was still figuring out the object-oriented programming back then, so the code was not pretty at all, but hey, it worked anyway.
As the years went by and I kept developing my programming skills, I always had the desire to redo the algorithm with the best practices I have learned and in my favorite programming language: C#.</description>
