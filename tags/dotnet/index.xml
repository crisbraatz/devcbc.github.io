      <description>Refreshing the memory In the previous post I focused on the algorithm, but my main goal described in the third paragraph was to release the project as an online simulator! In order to achieve that, I had decided to built it with the fresh Blazor framework, which per Microsoft:
 &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.&amp;rdquo;
 I will not dive into the Blazor framework itself since my focus in this post is on how to publish this type of project as a static website on Github Pages.</description>

      <description>The motivation When I was in college, I attended a course of crypthography which whom our professor challenged us to code the enigma machine algorithm in Java. I was still figuring out the object-oriented programming back then, so the code was not pretty at all, but hey, it worked anyway.
As the years went by and I kept developing my programming skills, I always had the desire to redo the algorithm with the best practices I have learned and in my favorite programming language: C#.</description>
